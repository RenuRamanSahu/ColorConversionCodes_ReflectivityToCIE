# ColorConversionCodes_ReflectivityToCIE
To obtain CIE color coordinates from reflectivity spectra of a sample go through the folowing steps:

1) Open the file ReflectivityData.py
2) Input your reflectivity file name. Here we are using the data file sample3.txt which has Reflectivty vs wavelength data.
3) Run the program.

The functions for color conversion are written in R2cie.py 
Make sure that the file is imported in your program so that you can use the functions.
